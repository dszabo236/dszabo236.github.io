Welcome to my webpage. Some of my current interests include Machine Learning, AI, Computer Vision, Robotics, Autonomous Systems, and web development. Outside of tech, I'm a tennis player and saxophonist. 

You'll find some of my more notable projects on this webpage. I'm currently looking for internships; if you're looking for a fast learner and driven worker, take a look at my resume!
